# WarGame

This is the code for a World War II boardgame. The game play is basically the same as [Axis and Allies](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/98/axis-allies), with a few modifications.

The interface is derived from Scott Nesin's brilliant work at http://gamesbyemail.com. The map is a recolored version of the one at https://www.axisandallies.org/forums/index.php?topic=11672.0; I used the setup charts from there too.

Images for the units came from the [Historic Naval Ships Association](http://archive.hsna.org), particularly their copy of the [War Department's FM 30-50, "Recognition: Pictorial Manual of Naval Vessels"](http://archive.hnsa.org/doc/id/fm30-50-naval/index.htm) and the [War Department's FM 30-30, "Recognition: Pictorial Manual"](http://archive.hnsa.org/doc/id/fm30-30-air/index.htm) for planes. The artillery images were created from ones I found online, usually at Wikipedia, and the infantry images are derived from pictures of figurines I found online, but I can't remember the original source for them.
